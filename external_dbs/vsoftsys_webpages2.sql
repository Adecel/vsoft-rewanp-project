The immigration process is incredibly case specific to the point that if it is not handled properly, it can immediately end with a negative outcome. \r\nToday, we discuss the reasons why you, as a person or as an organisation, should make use of an immigration consultancy for all the nitty gritty details that the immigration process has to offer.\r\nImmigration is not going to happen overnight. In fact, there is a common misconception that in a couple of weeks, one can pack up all their stuff and head out the door to a better life. \r\nImmigration takes months – and more often than not – years to achieve. Just the documentation collection stage alone can take a few months due to the number of documents required to even be considered for this type application. And that’s all assuming that you have the correct, up to date document list for all the necessary pieces of information requested by a foreign government.\r\nBefore one takes on the task of dusting off their old certificates and papers, one will first have to determine whether or not they are even eligible for immigration. With differences in tertiary education levels from country to country, correct working experience and language proficiency to name a few, you want to know where you stand prior to actually starting an application. Where one can spend a large amount of money in Portugal or Malta to obtain a permanent residence status, a country like Australia or Canada could have a completely different (and more accessible) process for obtaining permanent residence.\r\nIt\'s important to have yourself assessed before you even look at spending money, as you may very well qualify for a route that you hadn\'t even thought of. This is where immigration consultancies come into play. The consultancy will review your specifics (work experience, education, age, marital status, etc.) and then determine where your best options lie.\r\nScam artists and frauds have plagued the Immigration Industry for decades and in the modern era this has not changed so one must ensure that whoever they are talking to is a credible and confirmed source. \r\nNo matter how serious a query may or may not be regarding immigration, rather talk to a certified and legitimate consultancy. Immigration is no walk in the park, with most interest being based on goals for personal growth or for a household the last thing anyone wants is to end up with a negative outcome and waste of resources. \r\nWe have around 518 Google Reviews with a 4,7 rating meaning we have a 94 % positive rating with our satisfied clients .

(6, 'Denied at Port of Entry- What are your rights in South Africa?', '[\"Monday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\"]', '59206_Denied Entry in South Africa.jpg', 'jpg', 'Entry Denied at Port of Entry- What are your rights in South Africa?\r\n\r\nSouth Africa is the destination of choice for many people from the continent and the world.  As a result of this the country’s ports receive millions of travellers annually entering for various reasons. However, on occasion a traveller is refused entry having been deemed ineligible for entry into the Republic for one or more reasons. Often persons who find themselves in this position are summarily sent back to their country of embarkation without being informed of their rights if any under our law and how to exercise these rights. In this week’s piece we will explore what the Immigration Act provides for persons in this position as well as what our courts have concluded in cases involving persons who have been refused entry.\r\nSection 8(1) of the Immigration Act regulates what happens to a person who has been refused entry at a port of entry.  Section 8(1) provides “An immigration officer who refuses entry to any person or finds any person to be an illegal foreigner shall inform that person on the prescribed form that he or she may in writing request the Minister to review that decision and- \r\n1. a) If he or she arrived by means of a conveyance which is on point of departing and is not call at any other port of entry in the Republic, that request shall without delay be submitted to the minister; or \r\n2. b) in any other case than the one provided for in paragraph (a), that request shall be submitted to the minister within three days after that decision. \r\nTwo key rights are expressed in this section, the first one is the right to be notified of the reasons for being denied entry and secondly the right to make an appeal to the Minister to review the decision. The Act also makes provision for a time frame of when the appeal should be made in these two instances when entry has been refused.   The first arises when the conveyance is set to depart and will not call upon another port of entry in which case that appeal must be made immediately. The second instance is when conveyance is not at the point of departing, in which case the appeal must be made within three days from the act of being refused entry.\r\nIn section 8(2) the Immigration Act goes on to provide that if any person is refused entry or found to be an illegal foreigner as contemplated above, who has requested a review of such decision but is on a conveyance that is set to depart as contemplated in section 8(1)(a) shall depart on that conveyance and shall await the outcome of the review outside the republic. In a case arising under section 8(1)(b) , where the conveyance is not at the point of departure and the person has lodged an appeal with Minster the Act provides that this person  Shall not be removed from the republic before the Minister has confirmed the relevant decision. Here is where the problems tend to begin, firstly most are not informed of their rights as required by the Act but where they are informed there seems to be a concerted effort by the Immigration officials to secure the immediate removal of the person notwithstanding the protections afforded to the person.\r\nThe right to review and to reasons are hallmarks of our administrative law and are enshrined in the section 33 of the Constitution which vests everyone who is at the receiving end of an adverse decision by the state the right to appeal that decision and the demands that the public official must provide reasons of their decision in writing.  Our law recognises that the right to Just administrative action has two key aspects, the first one being the substantive aspect encapsulated in the statement the administrative action must be lawful or put differently it must be in line with an empowering legislation and the constitution. The second relates to the procedural fairness, the conduct or act must conform to procedural prescripts of the Act. Meaning where the Act says the official must inform the person by issuing a form 1, the failure to issue that form renders the action unlawful.\r\nIn the past when Home Affairs has been challenged on actions its officials have taken to deny a person entry they have put forward two principal arguments, first that have stated that once they have denied some one entry that person is no longer their responsibility but that of the conveyance as contemplated in section 35(10) of the Immigration Act.  The have also argued that technically persons in the arrivals area at the port of entry who have not been formally admitted into the republic are not in the republic and therefore not subject to the protections afforded to them by the Act and the constitution.  A final argument has been that in cases where a person has lodged an appeal in terms section 8(2)(b) wherein the Act provides that person shall not be removed from the republic, that person is not deprived if freedom as contemplated in section 12 of the constitution while also arguing they cannot be allowed to await the Ministers decision in the republic as doing so would be detrimental to their immigration enforcement efforts.\r\nAll these arguments have been dismissed out of hand by the courts.  In Lawyers for Human rights & another// the Minster of t Home Affairs & another 2004 (4) SA 125 (CC) the Constitutional court held that “The denial of these rights to human beings who are physically inside the country at sea or airports merely because they have not  entered South Africa formally would constitute a section of the values underlying our constitution”\r\nIn other Judgments in the SCA and High court this argument was dismissed as pure sophistry which ought to be disregarded offhand and that our courts would have jurisdiction to intervene in these matters in the same manner as they would be expected to intervene in a case involving the murder of a person at a port or entry.  In Abdi V the Minister of Home Affairs  (734/10) 2011  ZASCA 2, the Supreme court of Appeal found that Home Affairs remained the responsible authority when a person has been refused entry and they do not at any point abdicate that responsibility to the conveyance\r\nAs to whether a court can order the release of an inadmissible foreigner from an inadmissible faculty pending the outcome of a review of the decision the courts appear divided with judgements for and against the release.  In Chen v the Director General of Home Affairs 2014 ZAWCHC 181, the court having assessed the conditions of the holding facilities at the airport concluded that these holding facilities were in fact detention facilities that had the effect of violating a person’s fundamental right to dignity and the right to freedom and security of person and her right to freedom of movement.  The court went on to order the release of the person pending the minister’s decision but left it to the DHA to determine the conditions of the persons release.\r\nAs a final note for the airline industry who often find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place in these situations. It is worth noting the judgment of the High Court in Lin & Another v the Minster of Home Affairs & others. The court made several adverse findings against the airline in that case including punitive orders for contempt of court against certain employees of the airline.  The airline had argued that their function was to merely carry out the orders of the Home Affairs in this case however the court found them wanting and essentially stating that where the airline has been advised of the persons rights it has a duty to ensure that they do not participate in the violation of that persons rights by observing the letter of the law and not blindly follow the instruction of DHA which often have been found to be unlawful.\r\nwww.samigration.com', 'active', NULL, NULL, '2022-04-03 08:30:22', '2022-07-26 03:20:39', NULL),

The ban applies to any person who has overstayed, adults and children. The ban and\r\nbeing declared ‘undesirable’ also affects people who leave South Africa while their application for a visa (or visa extension) is pending, if their current visa has expired.\r\nwhat happens if i overstay my visa?\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Department of Home Affairs introduced new immigration regulations, which\r\neffectively \'ban\' foreign nationals who overstay in the Republic from re-entering South Africa fora set period of time.\r\nThe immigration laws in South Africa state that a person who overstays in the Republic after the expiry of their visa will be declared as \'undesirable\'. This person would receive a document, confirming them to be an \'undesirable\' person, when they exit South Africa. Their passport is also stamped. The document \'bans\' them from re-entering South Africa. The length of time that you are banned for depends on how long you have overstayed your visa.\r\n\r\nPersons who overstay their visa for a period of less than 30 days will be declared\r\n‘undesirable’ and banned for a period of 12 months. This means that this person will not\r\nbe allowed to re-enter South Africa for 12 months.\r\nPersons who overstay their visa by more than 30 days will be declared ‘undesirable’ and\r\nbanned for a period of 5 years. This means that this person will not be allowed to reenter\r\nSouth Africa for the next five years.\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN I DO IF I RECEIVE A BAN?\r\nYou are able to appeal a ban. The Immigration Act allows for people to lodge a formal appeal\r\nrequest to the Department of Home Affairs if they have been declared ‘undesirable’ and received a ban. The appeal must be submitted within ten working days of the day that you received the\r\nban. To submit an appeal, you must email your request to the Department of Home Affairs,\r\n\r\nWritten representations/letter with clear reasons for overstay,\r\nA copy of the document declaring you \'undesirable\' (you would have received this at\r\nthe border upon leaving South Africa, and a stamp in your passport),\r\nA copy of your passport: the information page and other relevant pages, such as\r\npages with your South African visa(s), stickers or stamps,\r\n\r\nIf your visa has expired and your application for extension is still pending, do not leave\r\nSouth Africa unless travel is absolutely necessary. Contact a reputable immigration advisor or\r\nattorney should you have to travel.\r\n\r\nMy ban has finished - can i return to south africa?\r\n\r\nNo You can only return to South Africa once you have applied to the South African Department of Home Affairs for the ban to be lifted as it is not automatically removed from the system. You must apply for the ban to be lifted. If you do not, you will be refused entry into South Africa at the Port of Entry.\r\n.\r\nHAS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACTED THIS?\r\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the South African government implemented a nationwide\r\nlockdown as well as a closure of its borders. This meant that many people were unable to return to their country of origin before their visas expired.\r\n\r\nAny person who did receive a declaration of undesirability during this period, should have that ban set aside. You should contact the email address provided above to clarify this situation and ensure that any ban that may have been noted, is removed. \r\n\r\nHow can we help you , please email us to info@samigration.com whatsapp me on: \r\n +27 82 373 8415, where are you now? check our website : www.samigration.com\r\n\r\nPlease rate us by clinking on this links : \r\nSa Migration Visas\r\nhttps://g.page/SAMigration?gm\r\nAlternatively , please contact us on :\r\n\r\n Whatsapp  Tel No : +27 (0) 82 373 8415\r\n\r\nTel No office : +27 (0) 82 373 8415 ( Whatsapp ) \r\nTel No admin : +27 (0) 64 126 3073\r\nTel No sales : +27 (0) 74 0366127\r\nFax No : 086 579 0155\r\n\r\nwww.samigration.com', 'active', NULL, NULL, '2022-04-03 14:45:19', '2022-07-26 03:20:07', NULL),

What are the key services a Visa Consultant Provide? \r\nSA Migration  - Immigration Consultants \r\nWhy would I hire an Immigration consultant to apply for a Visa? This was the question in the mind of Tanuj, when he was planning to apply for a South African PR visa for the very first time. In fact, this is the question that comes in the mind of every Visa applicant when he goes on to apply for a foreign visa. Well, let’s first find out what happened to Tanuj?\r\nTanuj had heard a lot about a few consultants involved in wrong practices and making money out of the immigration applicants by misguiding them. So, he decided to apply himself, despite having very little knowledge about visa process of South Africa. Unfortunately, he failed to register properly on the online immigration system of South Africa and also got stuck with the procedural guidelines. Now, finally he decided to contact a consultant for immigration to South Africa and begun the process again. Luckily, this time round he got successful and received an invite from authorities to apply for visa. what Tanuj said...?\r\nIf I had gone with SA Migration the first time I would have saved myself so much heart ache , cost , disappoint – They know their subject – I can highly recommend them\r\nCan you apply for a Visa without immigration Consultant?\r\nThis might have happened so many times around you. A person applies for the visa himself, gets it wrong, and finally opts to hire a consultant. It’s not that you can’t apply without the help of a consultant however, it depends on the individuals, i.e. how knowledgeable or well versed you are with immigration procedure of the country you are applying to.\r\nIf you are confident and informed enough about visa procedure and immigration guidelines, you can apply on your own and secure your visa too. On the other end, if you are not sure about immigration procedure, it is strictly advised not to go for it on your own and take service from a genuine and registered immigration consultant. Immigration to any country involves several procedural things and legal terms, which if you misinterpret, can result in the unwanted delay or denial of your visa.\r\n What are the Services an immigration Consultant offer?\r\nIt’s crucial to understand here that not every immigration consultant is fraudulent. There are consultants who are genuine and offer the quality immigration services as well to ensure that you get timely visa approval. Hence, it all depends how you choose a visa consultant to apply for immigration to another country. Always select a registered immigration consultant that offers all the key immigration services. Below are the key services an immigration consultant usually offers:\r\n• Pre-Assessment: Reviewing the profile of an applicant and doing thorough assessment to determine his/her eligibility for the given visa category or program.\r\n• Documentation Assistance: Informing the candidates about all the key documents and helping them in obtaining essential certifications (i.e. IELTS Test, skill assessment, ECA through WES, etc.)\r\n• Letter Drafting: Preparing a letter to be written to the authority.\r\n• Visa Application: Filing visa application to the immigration office, and entering all the details with 100% accuracy to avoid any delay and denial.\r\n• Resume Rebuilding: There are a few immigration consultancies which provide the Resume Rebuilding service as well. They assess your resume and upgrade it, keeping in mind the employers and job market of your destined country.\r\n• Refusal Case Analysis and Refiling: Handling the denial cases and filing the visa again with the authorities after efficiently removing the rejection.\r\nHow to Choose a Genuine Immigration Consultant?\r\nAs already discussed, the first thing you need check is that the immigration consultant you choose is registered with the immigration regulatory body of your destined country. Apart from this it’s also vital to read the testimonials and review about the company from various online and offline sources.\r\nExplore the website of your immigration consultant closely and find out the key details, i.e. accreditation, testimonials, office address, content quality posted on website (i.e. Blogs, articles, news, and immigration procedures, etc.).\r\nTo get further assistance in this regard you may write us to our email id- info@samigration.com .com.

(17, 'South African Retirement Visa', '[\"Monday\",\"Thursday\",\"Saturday\"]', '89128_retired.jpg', 'jpg', 'South African Retirement Visa\r\nA retirement visa can be granted for 4 years to someone with a monthly pension, irrevocable annuity or retirement account of R37 000 from a net worth/combination of assets realizing R37 000 per month and wishes to retire temporarily or permanently in South Africa.\r\nA South African Retired Person\'s permit is ideal for people wishing to retire in South Africa temporarily or permanently subject to the financial criteria or parameters being satisfied. This South African visa category is designed for those intending to retire in the country or wishing to have a long stay in South Africa with the need to renew the visa or permit. This retirement visa is not based on age but rather on assets, rental income and / or bank accounts generating income. It is based upon foreigner providing proof that such foreigner has the right to a pension or an annuity or retirement account which will give such foreigner a prescribed minimum payment for the rest of his or her life from the country of his or her origin; or a minimum prescribed net worth generating income for life.\r\nThis South African immigration visa is a popular option for seasonal visitors, i.e. those visiting the country for a period of six months or more. An important point to observe is that successful applicants are under no obligation to apply for permanent residence.\r\nThe temporary grant may be renewed indefinitely so long as the requirements continue to be met. However, permanent residency does bestow additional benefits upon its holder. In South Africa, immigration through the retired person\'s route can be either a temporary visa permit or a permanent residence visa as outlined in the eligibility criteria summarized below.\r\n• The temporary route is granted for four years and is renewable indefinitely for four-year periods.\r\n• The permanent route offers permanent residents the same rights and privileges as those with South African citizenship, with a few key exceptions, most notably the right to vote.\r\nIn both the temporary and permanent residence category the, South African Retired Persons Visa is based upon financial criteria and unlike a South African Work Visa, no prior job offer needs to be in place before an application can be made. Although unlike temporary South African visit visas, retired people can permitted to work if they wish, provided they apply under the correct visa category – Retirement plus Work Visa We wish to stress that the category “retired person\", does not confer a maximum or minimum age limit for this class of visa for South Africa. Retired person\'s visas may be awarded to people of all ages, provided that the eligibility requirements below are met.\r\n• A pension, retirement account or irrevocable annuity which has a value of at least R37, 000 per month. This requirement applies to each person making an application.\r\n• Alternatively, candidates may obtain a South African visa of this kind by demonstrating a \"net worth\" through a combination of assets which equates to a minimum of R37, 000 per month. Once again, this criterion applies to each person making an application.\r\nWork Conditions\r\nThe nature of this type of immigration to South Africa is such that no specific stipulations are in place regarding a candidate\'s ability to work in South Africa. In most cases, it may be assumed that people embarking upon this route, based as it is upon a steady income from a source other than employment will not be entering the country to work. However, each case will be considered individually and candidates may be able to work during their time in the country.\r\nApplicants wishing to work will need to submit an employment contract and is not required to demonstrate that a South African citizen or resident is available for the position. The idea here is that applicants under this category can supplement their income and that the rules have been relaxed significantly from the stringent work visa requirements.\r\nAccompanying Dependents\r\nSpouse immigration and dependent immigration are now provided through temporary South African Retired person\'s visas. This route to South Africa is based upon the financial security of each applicant and unlike work permit visas or business visas, the dependent family members of retired applicants automatically qualify for visit visa status to accompany the principle applicant and does not have to meet the same criteria for temporary residence but for the purposes of permanent residence they are treated as one family unit.\r\nHowever, in cases where an applicant successfully obtains permanent residence as a retired person, their spouse and/or dependent children, i.e. those aged under 21 will also qualify for permanent residency.\r\nFinancially Independent\r\nAn alternative route exists in the financially independent visa for which candidates would need to be able to demonstrate a net asset value totalling not less than R12 million.\r\nIn addition, it would also be necessary to demonstrate proof of payment of R120,000 as a non-refundable sum to the Director General of Home Affairs.

This process is mandatory and for this we would need your academic transcripts and award diplomas. Note under the regulations provision is made for the recognition of work experience in the absence of formal qualifications and this therefore makes provision recognition of prior work experience (RPL).\r\n\r\nThis is a paper based system which merely compares the foreign qualifications and arrives at an equivalent qualification in SA, and if qualified in SA then no SAQA needed.\r\n\r\nNext your employer has to prove that you are the only person that can fill the position and no other South African can fill that role.

Such body must also confirm the applicant’s skills, qualifications and working experience.\r\nFurthermore, such applicant’s qualifications need to be evaluated relevant to a South African level. An applicant for a Critical Skills Visa may enter South Africa on such visa without having secured a job offer first. It is, however, required of the applicant to confirm employment with the Department of Home Affairs within a period of one (1) year upon arrival in South Africa, failing which, the Visa would automatically lapse.\r\nThe Critical Skills Work Visa is tied to an individual and not to an employer so under this Visa a person can leave from one employer to the next without obtaining a new work Visa.\r\nwww.samigration.com', 'active', NULL, NULL, '2022-04-03 17:29:03', '2022-07-26 03:07:54', NULL),

You have no idea how you’re going to do this. You don’t even know if it’s still possible to submit a renewal!\r\nTake a deep breath – this does not have to happen to you.\r\nYou can avoid any visa renewal shocks and surprises simply by keeping these 5 facts in mind:\r\n1. Did you know applications must be submitted at least 60 days before the expiry date of the visa\r\nSouth Africa’ Immigration Act requires visa holders to submit renewals at least 60 days before the expiry date of their visa. Visa holders may also submit renewals earlier but no earlier than 6 months prior to a visa’s expiry date.\r\nOur advice? Don’t wait for the 60 days! Submit as early as possible to allow for unforeseen hiccups.\r\n2. Start the groundwork early\r\nThe process of renewing a South African visa is the same as applying for a new visa. For this reason, it is advisable to start preparing for a renewal well in advance.\r\nWhen it comes to work visas specifically, there are often multiple steps that need to be followed before being able to submit the renewal to the authorities. Given the backlog at Home Affairs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend starting the preparation process 12 months in advance.\r\n3. The visa holder must meet all the requirements again\r\nTo apply for a visa extension, the visa holder must be able to meet the requirements of their visa again. This includes any new requirements or changes to requirements that were made by the Department of Home Affairs since the previous application or renewal.\r\nApplicants who can’t meet the requirements of their visa will most likely not get a visa extension.\r\nThat does not mean it’s the end of the road! Unsuccessful renewal applicants can get assessed against all of South Africa’s immigration requirements to see if they perhaps qualify for another visa that lets them work in South Africa.\r\n4. Keep critical documentation up to date\r\nWant to save yourself a lot of headaches? Ensure that documentation with expiry dates are always valid. By keeping documents up to date, you’ll see to it that you’re ready to proceed with renewals as soon as it’s necessary.\r\nPolice clearances is one example of documentation with an expiry date. These documents are only valid for 6 months from the date of issuance. The passport expiration date is also an important one to keep in mind. It is impossible to apply for a visa with an expired passport.\r\n5. Extensions must be submitted in South Africa\r\nAll extensions must be submitted in South Africa, at a VFS application centre. Visa holders can’t submit extensions outside of South Africa.\r\nNeed help with South African visa renewals?\r\nOur corporate team can assist you with all types of South African visa renewals.
