                    <p>
                        Fast-growing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is changing the way we live and cities operate. The Smart City solution is a comprehensive system that features top-level design, integration, operations, service applications, and new ICT infrastructure. Cities use new ICT to sense, analyze, and converge key data from city operations and management systems, so that managers can intelligently respond to a variety of governance, livelihood, and business needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast, open exchange of data is key to building better cities — so a Smart City provider like VSOFTsystems focuses on ICT infrastructure and teams with partner companies to develop open, customer-centric solutions in order to build a sustainable Smart City ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VSOFTsystems Smart City Solution incorporates cloud, network, and platform technologies, along with robust security. VSOFTsystems safeguards Smart Cities with six security mechanisms: Physical, network, host, virtualization, application, and data.
