                            If you have been wondering to find someone other than checking when they were last credit active here is the answer. Currently the consumer profiles offered allow you to see who else has done a credit check on a person, all the latest contact details of the person (when doing an enquiry you typically have to update the details) and most importantly, the details of any bad debts or judgments in that personâ€™s name.
