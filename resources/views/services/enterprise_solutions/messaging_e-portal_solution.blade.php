                        VSOFTsystems has developed a unique system that specialises in e-billing and the delivery of documents, 
                        statements and advertising to client visa SMS or MMS. The end user receives the e-mail with the same 
                        look and feel of the original paper document, together with value added functionality that is absent 
                        in the paper-based version.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our innovative and client centred approach coupled with our new market innovative approach we have 
                        positioned itself as a market leader in electronic document generation, delivery and management company.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        VSOFTsystems was borne out of niche market spectrum which required an IT solution based business which 
                        per our clients needed to be quick and response to the fast pace of the IT world. With the problems and 
                        the deterioration of the postal delivery services we looked at options at meeting this need by our 
                        clients to communicate with their clients in a new and real time environment. An added challenges was 
                        that due to density of population and no easy way to confirm delivery of documents, a means of client 
                        communication had to be found and we have found with the increased density of clients footprints via 
                        cellphone and internet the new world of e billing and e documents was born which was a fraction of 
                        the printed costs. We offer a flexible and proven e-billing solution that is customised to each 
                        company's specific requirements.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our systems are such that the recipient receives their documents electronically with the same 
                        "look and feel" as the original paper-based document, together with value added functionality 
                        that the paper-based document did not have.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This technologically advanced and easy-to-use system sends documentation such as invoices, 
                        statements, payslips, reports and notifications, securely by e-mail, and sends transaction-based 
                        information via SMS. Our generation system is tightly integrated with a user-friendly Tracking and 
                        Management System, which makes it easy to manage electronically stored documents. Monitoring 
                        bounced e-mail and resending undelivered documents is both quick and convenient.
